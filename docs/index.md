# Introduction

**Dasolve** is a framework for the ones that want to build enterprise data-driven solutions in the right way.
The framework adopts all the best practices from the enterprise software industry without the fluffy details. No fancy libraries, no complex abstractions, no unnecessary complexity. Just the right amount of code to get the job done and show your solution to your boss and keep working on it without having to rewrite everything once you go to production and figure out a full rewrite is the best solution to continue the development process.

If you are doing PoCs, MVPs or just want to show some fast results, Dasolve maybe is not the right tool for you. Dasolve is a framework for the ones that want to deploy data-driven solutions in production with confidence. It is a framework for the ones that want to build data-driven solutions in the **right way**.

**Dasolve** is a framework that requires more time to produce results. It's not a framework that will give you results in a few minutes. It's a framework that will give you consistent results in the long run and will help you to build data-driven solutions that are easy to maintain and extend over time. It emphasizes quality and maintainability over speed. So instead of rushing to deliver a quick-and-dirty solution that will be hard to maintain and extend over time, Dasolve encourages you to take the time to build a solid foundation that will pay off in the long run (weeks to months depending on how complex the solution is).

## Principles

**Dasolve** is built based on the following principles:

- **Simplicity**: Dasolve is built on top of the simplest possible abstractions. It doesn't try to be a one-size-fits-all solution. It doesn't try to be a framework that does everything. It tries to be a framework that helps you in the long run of the development process.
- **Security**: Dasolve prioritizes security by implementing best practices and ensuring that data is handled in a way that your IT organization won't complain.
- **Maintainability**: Dasolve is built with maintainability in mind. It doesn't try to be a framework that does everything. It tries to be a framework that helps you in the long run of the development process.
- **Quality**: the code that you will produce in Dasolve will be of high quality. It will be easy to read and understand. It will be easy to maintain and extend over time. It will be easy to test and deploy.

## Who Is It For?

**Dasolve** is for:

- Enterprise Developers: Professionals building data-driven applications within medium to large organizations who need a robust, maintainable framework.
- Data driven engineers and scientists looking to transition from prototypes to production-ready applications.
- Teams prioritizing long-term maintainability, security, and quality in their software solutions but leveraging a modern tech stack.
- Enterprise consultancy developers seeking a standardized framework to streamline project delivery and ensure compliance with industry best practices.
- Software architects aiming to establish a consistent architectural approach for data-driven applications across their organization.
- Development teams in regulated industries that require strict compliance with security and data handling policies.

## Is Dasolve Right for You?

Consider using Dasolve if one of those statements apply to you:

- You are building a data-driven application that requires a robust and maintainable architecture.
- You want to leverage modern technologies and best practices in your development process.
- You prioritize long-term maintainability, security, and quality in your software solutions.
- You prefer to go with opinionated frameworks that enforce best practices rather than flexible, do-it-yourself solutions.
- You want to avoid the pitfalls of quick-and-dirty solutions that lead to technical debt and maintenance nightmares.
- You want to reach the deadlines with a solution that is production-ready from day one.
- You want to make sure that what you are delivering is of high quality and maintainable in the long run.
- You are working within a medium to large organization and need a framework that aligns with enterprise standards.
- You are working in a regulated industry that requires strict compliance with security and data handling policies.

Consider running your own custom solution if one of those statements apply to you:

- You are building fast PoCs that have no intention to become production-ready.
- You just want to make a website or a small application that doesn't require a robust architecture.
- You want to experiment with new technologies and frameworks without the constraints of an opinionated framework.
- You need a highly customized solution that deviates significantly from standard best practices.
- You are working on a small project with a tight deadline that prioritizes speed over maintainability and quality.
