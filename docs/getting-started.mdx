# Getting Started

The most important part of dasolve is to plan your solution. First thing you need to do is to create a sketch of your solution. This will help developers to visualize and understand the problem and what is your vision about the solution.

After you have created a sketch, you can start specifying your solution. The specification will come in 3 parts and must be executed in the following order:

- Data
- UI
- UX

## Data

With the sketch in hand, you already have a very clear idea of what data you need to collect and how it will be used in your solution. The next step is to create a data model that will represent the data you need to collect. This model will be used to create the database schema and tables that will store the data your solution needs.




To get started, start with an empty git repository. Then you need to initialize a Dasolve solution. You can do this by running the following command:

<Tabs groupId="language">
  <TabItem value="bun" label="bun" default>
    `bunx dasolve init`
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="pip" label="pip">
    Coming soon...
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
